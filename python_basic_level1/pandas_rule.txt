whenever apply is there we should have lambda
sort_values(ascending=False) is better than nlargest for grouping multiple columns
groupby is there and then correspnding column should in [] for mean, sum, average()
subset is most for  dropna, drop_duplicates(), fillna but fillna needs to have methods
no subset is needed for drop
concat we need to drop index
merge we dont need to do anything

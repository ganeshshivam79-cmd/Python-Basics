spark.sql.engine — What It Powers Internally:

The Spark SQL Engine is the core execution engine behind:

✅ spark.sql() (SQL queries)
✅ DataFrame API
✅ Dataset API

⚙️ What Does It Do Internally?

Catalyst Optimizer (Logical + Physical Plan Optimizer)
Analyzes and optimizes query plans.
Performs operations like predicate pushdown, constant folding, projection pruning, etc.

Tungsten Engine
Optimizes memory and CPU usage.
Generates Java bytecode for execution (whole-stage code generation).

🔥 Result:

Your code (SQL/DataFrame/Dataset) is converted to an optimized plan.
Spark generates bytecode for fast, efficient execution.
This bytecode runs inside the executors.

🧠 Summary:
Spark SQL Engine = Catalyst + Tungsten
Powers: spark.sql(), DataFrame, and Dataset APIs
Output: Optimized bytecode → Efficient execution on executor
